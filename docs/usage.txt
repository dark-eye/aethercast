Overview
========

This document describes the basic usage of the miracast management
service through its DBus API.

NOTE: The API is currently not fully implemented as described in
the specification. There is only a very simple and rough API in
place to manager the two use cases for scanning and connecting
a found device.

1. Scanning for available devices
---------------------------------

Scanning for available devices is performed through the manager
interface.

 $ gdbus call -y -d org.wds -o / -m org.wds.Manager.Scan

The method call will return once the scan is finished (current
timeout is 30 seconds).

NOTE: As of right there is no way to list any available devices
through the ObjectManager API.

2. Connecting a remote device
-----------------------------

For connecting a remote device we have to know its MAC address
for now until device management API is fully in place.

 $ gdbus call -y -d org.wds -o / -m org.wds.Manager.ConnectSink \
    'aa:bb:cc:dd:ee'

The call either returns with an error or without any return value
to indicate success.
