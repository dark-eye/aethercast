Manager hierarchy
=================

Service		org.wds
Interface	org.wds.Manager
Object path	/

Methods		void Scan()

			Trigger a scan for available display devices. The
			method call will return when a scan has been
			finished and results are available. So setting
			a longer D-Bus timeout might be a really good
			idea.

Properties	string State [readonly]

			The global connection state. Possible values are
			"offline", "idle" and "connected".

			If the underlaying transport technology is turned
			off the state will be "offline" to reflect we
			can't do any operation. All devices will be
			disconnected in this state.

			When the underlaying transport technology is
			turned on and no device is connected the manager
			will be in "idle" mode. This marks the manager
			as being ready to connect with a remote device.

			If atleast one device is connected the state
			will be "connected".
