DBus API Overview
=================

The service implements a top level manager object at / which implements
the following interfaces:

 - org.aethercast.Manager
 - org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager
 - org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties

Through the ObjectManager interface all device objects are managed.

The device objects itself will sit on a path formed by the following
format:

    /dev_*

Where the suffix will be some kind of identifier for the device. The
only valid way to find out which device objects are available is
through the ObjectManager interface.

Each device object will implement the following interfaces:

 - org.aethercast.Device
 - org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties

API Versioning
--------------

After the API is considered stable we will gurantee it will not break.
If breaking changes are introduced this will be reflected in the major
version of the service being increased and the interface being appened
with a increasing number. For example if the org.aethercast.Device interface
is changed in a breaking way a new interface will be defined with the
name org.aethercast.Device1 to reflect the API breakage.
