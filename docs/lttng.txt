Tracing with LTTng
==================

Aethercast has support for LTTng tracepoints for various events. You can
record tracepoints from aethercast with the following commands:

 $ lttng create aethercast-session -o /tmp/aethercast-session
 $ lttng enable-event -u -a
 $ lttng start
 $ AETHERCAST_REPORT_TYPE=lttng aethercast
 $ lttng stop
 $ lttng destroy aethercast-session

To allow tracepoints to be used at runtime after you have set the
AETHERCAST_REPORT_TYPE environment variable you need to make sure
the shared library libaethercast-lttng.so is properly installed
on your system.

On Ubuntu you can archive this by installing the aethercast-tools
package:

 $ apt-get install aethercast-tools

You can then analzye the results then with your tool of choice. See
the LTTng homepage at http://lttng.org/ for a list of possible tools
The easiest way is by using babeltrace.

 $ babeltrace /tmp/aethercast-session/<trace-subdir>
